****Advanced Vulnerability Scanner****


**Introduction**

The Advanced Vulnerability Scanner is a GUI-based tool designed to scan and detect vulnerabilities in a target system. It leverages the Nmap scanning engine to perform a variety of scan types, including basic scans, TCP connect scans, SYN scans, UDP scans, and even aggressive scans that include service version detection and OS fingerprinting. The tool is built with Python using the nmap library for scanning and Tkinter for the graphical user interface.


**Features**
Basic Scan: Quickly scans the top 100 most commonly used ports.
TCP Connect Scan: Detects open ports using a full TCP connection handshake.
SYN Scan: Performs a stealthy scan using half-open SYN connections.
UDP Scan: Detects open UDP ports (slower than TCP scans).
Service Version Detection: Identifies services and their versions running on open ports.
OS Detection: Attempts to detect the operating system of the target device.
Aggressive Scan: Performs detailed OS detection, service version detection, and other aggressive scanning techniques.



**Prerequisites**
Nmap: Ensure Nmap is installed on your system. You can download it from Nmap's official site.
Python 3.x: This tool requires Python 3.x to run.
Python Libraries:
nmap: Python binding for Nmap (install using pip install python-nmap)
tkinter: Pre-installed with Python, used for creating the graphical interface.
